      <h2>From Kindergarten to University</h2>
      <p>
        My education journey began at a small nursery school in my village, where I learned the basics of reading, writing, and counting.
        I later joined primary school at Tututha  and passed my KCPE with determination and discipline.

        I went to high school at Imale school where I discovered my love for technology and problem-solving.
        After KCSE results, I pursued a certificate, diploma, degree in Bachelor of business Information Technology at Zetech, where I’m currently completing my degree.
