      <h2>Growing Up in Kenya</h2>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in mbooni, makueni county, where my childhood was filled with joy, exploration, and laughter.
        I spent most of my early days playing games with family and friends, helping my family with chores, and learning life values from my grandparents.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my fondest memories is when all the family celebrates together during the festive seasons, sharing stories, food, and laughter. When our family meets it's always a time of joy and bonding.
        These moments taught me the importance of family, community, and cherishing the simple things in life.
